### Problem summary:
##### [[Full problem statement here](https://onlinejudge.org/external/121/12165.pdf)]
Given number of triangles N. Given 3 coordinates for a inner triangle. These points are P,R,Q. We are also given 6 side lengths for the outer triangle. These side lengths are labled as m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6. The goal is to find the outer triangles points A,B,C. <sup>1</sup> The following restrictions apply: N (0 < N < 25001), (0 ≤ Px, Py, Qx, Qy, Rx, Ry ≤ 10000), and six positive integers m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6
(m1 < m2, m3 < m4 and m5 < m6).

### The Goal:
Find the coordinates of the outer triangle.

### Explanation
After reading the problem about 50 times it is clear that we'll need to use some sort of geometry theorem in order to find the points. Since I'm not a math major and my geometry is awful I had to get help from three math professors and professor Griffin. Unfornately we could only come up with some ideas of how to solve this problem here are the attempts.<sup>5</sup>
